1. Data Cleaning:
Drop irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., the 'Unnamed: 32' column which seems to have all NaN values).
Check for and handle any missing values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Summarize the data to understand the distribution of features.
Visualize the data to identify any patterns or correlations.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Encode categorical variables.
Scale the features if necessary.

4. Model Building and Evaluation:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost).
Use performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

By comparing the precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC of the three models, we determine the best model is ADA BOOST MODEL for predicting breast cancer in this dataset.
